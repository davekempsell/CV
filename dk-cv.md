I am a software engineer with a background in elite sport as both an athlete and a coach. My unique experience in high performing teams has made the transition to working in agile development teams seamless. I’m a dedicated team player that holds myself and my team to exceptional standards, both in producing high-quality code and following best practice with our processes. 

I’m constantly looking to push myself out of my comfort zone to learn something new. I love the problem-solving aspect of coding, finding the best solutions to create cool things, and the need to be continuously learning and developing.

I have recently transitioned into tech from a career in sport as I wanted to broaden my opportunities. I enjoy learning about new technologies, and am excited by the possibility of being a part of an even more tech-integrated society. Coding provides an outlet to the same drive that served me well in my time as an athlete, where I can dedicate myself to being an excellent individual contributor, as well as making use of the soft skills developed over a decade of working with some exceptional athletes.

## Tech Experience

#### Makers Academy (May 2022 to August 2022)

On the Makers course I learnt technical skills such as OOP, TDD, pair programming, and learning a variety of new technologies. This time also allowed me to further develop skills that could transfer into working as a software engineer from my previous roles. I have always valued high attention to detail, and utilised this in debugging and refactoring code, as well as carrying out thorough testing on my code. Working with people remotely, with a wide range of backgrounds required new relationships to be built under sometimes challenging circumstances, such as during group projects with short deadlines.

I used the following tech during the Makers course:
- Ruby, RSpec, Capybara, Sinatra
- JavaScript, React Native, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress
- MongoDB, Mongoose, PostgreSQL
- HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Heroku

## Skills

#### Determination
I am driven towards ensuring the best possible outcome. My time competing as an athlete taught me the importance of embracing a growth mindset; seeing setbacks as learning opportunities, embracing challenges, and discovering that no task was insurmountable when approached with the right attitude. I worked to instil this mindset in the athletes I coached, and it has benefitted me hugely in my journey into software development. I have regularly set ambitious targets, and am undetered by needing to learn new technologies to get the job done.

For our final group project at Makers, we decided to create a mobile app, despite not having covered mobile technologies in the course. I spent a number of days looking up how to use React Native, following tutorials and creating an example app to understand the process. Within 10 days, we had learnt how to create two mobile apps using React Native, as well as building a cloud-hosted backend server using Node.js and Express.  The app was fully mobile, working on iPhone and Android phones, from any location with mobile signal. 

#### Excellent Communication

During the Tastebook group project at Makers, we faced challenges with varying levels of understanding and ability within the group. Discussing people's concerns with how they might be able to contribute effectively required emotional intelligence, guiding the conversation to ensure everyone felt comfortable to talk about how they felt, as well as elements of conflict-resolution when there were disagreements. I worked with the group to develop processes that would allow us to balance our aims of creating a working app, and ensuring everyone in the group was involved. We used agile processes to create tickets that had a variety of complexity and used different technologies so that every group member could complete items. We paired on tasks and carried out regular code reviews to ensure group-wide understanding of the project. I led regular team stand ups and retros to allow on-going communication, and the team was not only able to produce an app which we were proud of, but did so in a way that everyone was happy with their time spent on the project, not just the outcome.

Communication skills have been important throughout my time in rowing. There is no opportunity for a coach to provide in-game instruction, and there is little chance for talking during such high-intensity effort. Therefore, all race tactics and plans must be made clear to the athletes before they start. To ensure my athletes knew exactly what to do on race day, we would use visualisation to work through their expectations of events, and ensure we had open conversations about their motivations and concerns. Specific calls were planned for different times within the race, and practiced repeatedly in training so that the response was automatic.

#### Problem-Solving

I enjoy looking for solutions or improvements to current practices that can lead to better outcomes. Whilst an assistant rowing coach at Washington State University, I implemented a points based system for organising our recruiting strategy, allowing a staff of five coaches to successfully organise the recruitment of over 200 athletes throughout a six month period. I also started a state-wide talent search program looking for athletes from outside of the sport, contacting school principals and athletic directors to identify potential athletes and invite them to open days and try outs on campus.

Throughout my time on the Makers course, these problem-solving skills were invaluable. One instance was during the final group project, where we were attempting to find the best solution for the backend server for the app. We had looked at using Firebase, but with a number of technical issues alongside trying to learn how to integrate it into our app, we made the decision to move to building our own backend server. Myself and a team mate were able to get this operational within the day, sending and receiving APIs to allow our two front end mobile apps to interact with each other via a shared database.

## Work Experience

**Bedford Modern School** Bedford, UK (Aug 2019 - May 2022 and Oct 2014 - July 2016)  
_Senior Rowing Coach_
- Working with junior student-athletes required high levels of communication, understanding their motivations and concerns, as well as being able to interpret behaviour when verbal communication wasn't always forthcoming.
- Continuously set high standards, as a vital part of developing behaviours that would continue into students’ adult lives, as well as benefiting their performance as junior athletes.
- Managing the expectations of the athletes was an important part of ensuring they handled both success and failure in a healthy way that allowed them to continue to develop. I encouraged a growth mindset, to embrace challenges as learning opportunities, and to strive for continuous personal improvement.


**Washington State University** Pullman, WA, USA (Aug 2016 - June 2019)  
_Women's Rowing - Assistant Coach_
- As well as communication with elite college athletes, this role involved relationship building across the wider university community. Responsibilities included working alongside various academic departments during the recruitment of potential students to the university, and having an in-depth working knowledge of systems and practices, such as NCAA and US visa regulations.
- Training time was regulated, and planning and implementing a training program that maximised the time of our student-athletes required high attention to detail. Constructing training programs for athletes involved considering the fixed deadlines of competition dates, with the need for periodisation within the program to maximise physiological adaptations, and ensuring that the training load worked in conjunction with the varying academic workload of the school year.


_Research Assistant_
- Whilst completing a Masters degree in Sports Management, I assisted [Professor Scott Jedlicka](https://education.wsu.edu/scott-jedlicka/) with his research into International Sports Governance.

**Pertemps** Reading, UK (Oct 2014 - July 2016)  
_Recruitment Team Lead_
- Leading a team of six staff, tasked with the recruitment, and management, of around 200 temporary workers employed at Thames Water.
- Stakeholder management was a key part of the role, working with hiring managers to deliver the best recruitment experience, and ensuring staff provided by Pertemps were succeeding in their roles with Thames Water.

## Athletic Career
**England Rowing Team** (2010 & 2012)
I competed twice for the England team at the Home International Regatta, against Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Winning gold in the Coxed Four in 2012.
Competing on a representative team involved being adaptable and building relationships quickly, with often limited opportunities to practice as a full team before the event.


**Leander Club** (2012-2013)
Whilst rowing at Leander Club, a British Rowing High Performance Center, I achieved a 5th and 11th place finish at the GB Rowing Team National trials, and won Bronze at the 2013 British National Championships in the men's 8+ event. Training at a high-performance centre required a great deal of intrinsic motivation. Everyone was there to maximise their own performance, and I was only answerable to myself in training for up to six hours a day, six days a week.

**Star Club (Bedford)** (2006-2012)
Joining Star Club in 2007, I was part of a group that took a small, local rowing club to competing for National titles and beating some of the country's top performance centres. We set ambitious goals, and would regularly discuss as a group whether we thought we were on track to achieve those goals, and what we could improve and do differently to ensure we reached our targets.
Achievements with Star Club include winning silver at the 2011 British National Championships, winning the Britannia Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 2012, and setting a British Record for the Marathon distance on the rowing machine.

## Education

#### Washington State University (USA) (Aug 2016 - May 2018)
