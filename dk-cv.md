I am a software engineer with a background in elite sport as both an athlete and a coach. My unique experience in high performing teams has made the transition to working in agile development teams seamless. I’m a dedicated team player that holds myself and my team to exceptional standards. I’m constantly looking to push myself out of my comfort zone to learn something new.

| [**Mock tech test - Bank Account**](https://github.com/davekempsell/bank_account_tech_test.git) | An example technical test completed using a TDD process to build a basic 'bank account' simulator that takes deposits and withdrawals and displays transactions. Interaction with the app is through IRB | Ruby, RSpec |
| [**Mock tech test - Gilded Rose**](https://github.com/davekempsell/gilded-rose-tech-test.git) | An example technical test completed using a TDD process. The test is focussed on refactoring code, and in particular utilising polymorphism to create the most elegant solution to the problem. | JavaScript, Jest |

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2022 to August 2022)

An intensive, 16 week software engineering bootcamp, where I developed the following skills:
- **Object Oriented Programming** best practice, designing and building class based apps. Focus on concepts such as encapsulation, inheritence, and polymorphism.
- **Test Driven Development**. Using a TDD process to design and build programs, including unit tests, and integration and feature tests.
- **Agile practices** Our group projects involved regular stand-ups and retros, iterative development, using a Kanban board for organising tasks, and dividing projects into sprints.
- **Pair Programming**. Working with a variety of people highlighted the importance of being adaptable to accomodate other people's learning and working styles.

I used the following tech during the Makers course:
- Ruby, RSpec, Capybara, Sinatra
- JavaScript, React Native, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress
- MongoDB, Mongoose, PostgreSQL
- HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Heroku

The course included a number of individual and group projects. For the final, two week, group project, I created a loyalty app for independent coffee shops. Building two mobile apps using React Native, a backend server built on Node.js, using MongoDB Atlas, and cloud hosted on Heroku. The app was able to be deployed on mobile devices, and included a QR code system, with scanner, to enable users' accounts to be updated in real time.

#### Washington State University (USA) (Aug 2016 - May 2018)

- MA Education(Sport Management)
- 3.64 GPA
- I studied for this degree whilst working as rowing coach on a graduate assistantship, requiring the balance of two full time commitments.

#### University of Bedfordshire (Sept 2005 - May 2009)

- BSc Sport and Exercise Science
- 2:2
- In my final year at UoB, I successfully founded the University's first rowing team, recruiting students on campus, and coaching the team to race at the British University Championships in 2009 and 2010.

## Skills

### Determined
I am driven to create the best outcome possible. My time competing as an athlete taught me the importance of seeing setbacks as learning opportunities, embracing challenges, and discovering that no task was insurmountable when approached with the right attitude. I worked to instill this mindset in the athletes I coached, and it has benefitted me hugely in my journey into software development. I have regularly set ambitious targets, and am undettered by needing to learn new technologies to get the job done.

#### Adaptable

For our final group project at Makers, we wanted to make a mobile app, which required learning how to use new technologies as the course hadn't covered mobile apps. I spent a number of days looking up how to use React Native, following tutorials and creating an example app to understand the process. Within 10 days, we had learnt how to create two mobile apps using React Native that worked on members of the group's phones, completing a proof of concept prototype. 

#### Excellent Communication

During the Tastebook group project at Makers, we faced challenges with varying levels of understanding and ability within the group. We discussed people's concerns with how they might be able to contribute effectively, and I worked with the group to develop processes that would allow us to balance our aims of creating a working app, and ensuring everyone in the group was involved. We used agile processes to create work tickets that had a variety of complexity and used different technologies so that every group member could complete items. We also paired on tasks and carried out regular code reviews to ensure group-wide understanding of the project. I led regular team stand ups and retros to allow on-going communication, and the team was not only able to produce an app which we were proud of, but did so in a way that everyone was happy with their time spent on the project, not just the outcome.

#### Innovative

I enjoy looking for solutions or improvements to current practices that can lead to better outcomes. Whilst an assistant rowing coach at Washington State University, I implemented a points based system for organising our recruiting strategy, allowing a staff of five coaches to successfully organise the recruitment of over 200 athletes throughout a six month period. I also started a state-wide talent search program looking for athletes from outside of the sport, contacting school principals and athletic directors to identify potential athletes and invite them to open days and try outs on campus. 

## Work Experience

## Hobbies

I'm a keen cyclist, and my wife and I enjoy exploring new parts of the world on our bikes when we get the chance. I continue to coach rowing as a volunteer at my local club, and have held various positions within the club's management board.

I have recently taught myself how to make craft gin, and enjoy making new recipes and trying them out on willing friends and family.

I love to learn, and enjoy reading on a variety of topics. I am currently teaching myself Python.
