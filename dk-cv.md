## Dave Kempsell [(GitHub)](https://github.com/davekempsell)

I am transitioning into a career in tech after 15 years of working within sport and education. As an athlete I competed with the England Rowing Team, and since retiring from the sport I have coached within the UK and the United States, working in schools, universities, and community sports clubs.

I have recently completed the 12 week Makers Academy Bootcamp, and am currently looking for opportunities to work as a junior developer to utilise, and continue to build on, my skills.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Makers Project - Loyal Bean**](https://github.com/davekempsell/bean-app.git)| A loyalty mobile app for independent coffee shops. We created two mobile apps, one for customers and one for shops, that communicated through a QR code and scanner. Both apps connected to a cloud hosted backend server to allow real time updates.  | MongoDB, Atlas, Node.js, Express, React Native, XCode, Android Studio |
| [**Makers Project - Tastebook**](https://github.com/davekempsell/tastebook.git) | A full stack web app, designed as a facebook clone that allows users to post their favourite recipes and interact with others through comments and likes | JavaScript, Node, Express, Handlebars, CSS, Jest |
| [**Tech test - Bank Account**](https://github.com/davekempsell/bank_account_tech_test.git) | An example technical test completed using a TDD process to build a basic 'bank account' app that takes deposits and withdrawals and displays transactions. Interaction with the app is through IRB | Ruby, RSpec |
| [**Tech test - Gilded Rose**](https://github.com/davekempsell/gilded-rose-tech-test.git) | An example technical test completed using a TDD process. The test is focussed on refactoring code, and in particular utilising polymorphism to create the most elegant solution to the problem. | JavaScript, Jest |

## Work Experience

**Bedford Modern School** (Aug 2019 - May 2022)  
_Senior Rowing Coach_

- Whilst this role began as mostly delivering sports coaching, the advent of the pandemic in early 2020 led to the pastoral and leadership side of the position being hugely important. I was responsible for heading up coaching for the boys' side of a co-ed rowing program consisting of over 100 children aged 13-18. Working within the sports department of a large, independent day school, communication and planning was vital for delivering a successful program.

**Washington State University** (Aug 2016 - June 2019)  
_Women's Rowing - Assistant Coach_

- Working in the Athletic Department of a PAC-12 school, this role comprised technical instruction, guidance, and support for a large multi-national team of athletes. I was also responsible for recruiting athletes from within the US, and around the world.

_Research Assistant_

- Whilst completing a Masters degree in Sports Management, I assisted Professor Scott Jedlicka with his research into the use of major sports championships in 'sports washing'.

## Skills

#### Adaptable

For our final group project at Makers, we wanted to make a mobile app, which required learning how to use new technologies as the course hadn't covered mobile apps. I spent a number of days looking up how to use React Native, following tutorials and creating an example app to understand the process. Within 10 days, we had learnt how to create two mobile apps using React Native that worked on members of the group's phones, completing a proof of concept prototype. 

#### Excellent Communication

During the Tastebook group project at Makers, we faced challenges with varying levels of understanding and ability within the group. We discussed people's concerns with how they might be able to contribute effectively, and I worked with the group to develop processes that would allow us to balance our aims of creating a working app, and ensuring everyone in the group was involved. We used agile processes to create work tickets that had a variety of complexity and used different technologies so that every group member could complete items. We also paired on tasks and carried out regular code reviews to ensure group-wide understanding of the project. I led regular team stand ups and retros to allow on-going communication, and the team was not only able to produce an app which we were proud of, but did so in a way that everyone was happy with their time spent on the project, not just the outcome.

#### Innovative

I enjoy looking for solutions or improvements to current practices that can lead to better outcomes. Whilst an assistant rowing coach at Washington State University, I implemented a points based system for organising our recruiting strategy, allowing a staff of five coaches to successfully organise the recruitment of over 200 athletes throughout a six month period. I also started a state-wide talent search program looking for athletes from outside of the sport, contacting school principals and athletic directors to identify potential athletes and invite them to open days and try outs on campus. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2022 to August 2022)
- The course focussed on OOP, starting with Ruby, and then JavaScript. Over the 12 week course, I worked on front end and back end projects, ending with a final group project where we created two mobile apps using React Native that worked together via a QR code and scanner, linking to a cloud hosted backend server, built with Node.js, Express, hosted on Heroku.
- The course introduced a number of agile practices which were used throughout multiple group projects, including regular stand ups and retros, and using Kanban to organise tasks.
- Makers places a heavy emphasis on test driven development. Throughout the course I completed a number of external reviews to provide feedback and help me to hone my TDD processes.
- Regularly used pairing to approach problems, developing team work and communication within a small development team.
- Whilst the course focussed on two main languages in Ruby, and JavaScript, the regular introduction of new software, testing frameworks, and various technology stacks have resulted in me being comfortable to pick up new languages, demonstrated by my learning of React Native for the final project.

#### Washington State University (USA) (Aug 2016 - May 2018)

- MA Education(Sport Management)
- 3.64 GPA
- I studied for this degree whilst working as rowing coach on a graduate assistantship, requiring the balance of two full time commitments.

#### University of Bedfordshire (Sept 2005 - May 2009)

- BSc Sport and Exercise Science
- 2:2
- In my final year at UoB, I successfully founded the University's first rowing team, recruiting students on campus, and coaching the team to race at the British University Championships in 2009 and 2010.

## Hobbies

I'm a keen cyclist, and my wife and I enjoy exploring new parts of the world on our bikes when we get the chance. I continue to coach rowing as a volunteer at my local club, and have held various positions within the club's management board.

I have recently taught myself how to make craft gin, and enjoy making new recipes and trying them out on willing friends and family.
